# ESP32-websever
In this project you’ll create a standalone web server with an ESP32 that controls
outputs (two LEDs) using the Arduino IDE programming environment. 
The web server is mobile responsive and can be accessed with any device that as a browser,
on the local network. We’ll show you how to create the web server and how the code works step-by-step.
